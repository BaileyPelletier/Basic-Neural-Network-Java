# Toy-Neural-Network-Java

<p>This neural network is meant to be basic and simple in its design as it is a learning experience. Inlcuded in this repo is a Matrix class library that is also built from the ground-up. The basis of design for these libraries come from a similar repo, <b><a href="https://github.com/BaileyPelletier/Toy-Neural-Network-JS">Toy-Neural-Network-Java.</a></b></p>

  Steps:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Build Matrix Library    <i>(in progress...)</i></b>
      <ul>
        <li><del>Accessor/Mutator (Getter/Setter) Methods for Rows & Cols</del></li>
        <li><del>Constructors & from/toArray methods & toString()</del></li>
        <li><del>Initialization Methods (Random & Simple)</del></li>
        <li><del>Determinant & Matrix Minor (Took me ALL NIGHT!) derivation methods </del></li>
        <li>Matrix Operations!</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Build Neural Network Library</li>
    <li>Test libraries</li>
    <li>Add visualization?</li>
  </ul>
